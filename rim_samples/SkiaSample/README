SkiaSample

========================================================================
Description:

SkiaSample is a demo application designed to showcase some of Skia's
capabilities as a 2D drawing API.

========================================================================
Prerequisites:

BlackBerry Native SDK
A debug token installed on the PlayBoook.

========================================================================
Build Instructions:

1. Check out the Skia repository.
2. Import the grskia project into the NDK. The project is located
   directly inside of the checked out Skia folder.
3. Import the SkiaSample project into the NDK. The project is 
   located in Skia/rim_samples/SkiaSample.
4. Open the bar-descriptor.xml for the SkiaSample project.
   Click Set from Debug Token on the General tab and save the file.
5. If targeting a device running BlackBerry OS 1.x, switch to the Source
   tab for bar-descriptor.xml and uncomment the line which specifies the
   asset path for libbps.so.
6. Ensure that both grskia and SkiaSample use the same build configuration.
7. Build the grskia project first and then build SkiaSample.
8. Deploy the sample executable to the PlayBook by selecting
   Run -> Run As -> BlackBerry Tablet OS C/C++ Application.

========================================================================
Toggling hardware acceleration in SkiaSample (Optional)

Open SkiaSample/main.cpp and find the USE_SKIA_OPENGL define near the top.
To use hardware-accelerated Skia, set USE_SKIA_OPENGL to 1.
To use software Skia, set USE_SKIA_OPENGL to 0.
